//! Browser-to-shelf book upload plumbing.
//!
//! The wifi task receives raw EPUB bytes over HTTP and streams them to
//! the display task (the single SD owner) through a two-buffer
//! ping-pong: chunks carry loaned 4 KB buffers one way, the buffers
//! come back on the return channel once written. The display task holds
//! one SD session for the whole upload phase and writes /BOOKS/<8.3>.
//!
//! The pure pieces — name derivation, label shaping, identity-sidecar
//! parsing — live in `proto::upload` so host `cargo test` covers them
//! (this crate only compiles for the firmware target).

// riscv32imc has no CAS; portable-atomic provides it on single-core.
