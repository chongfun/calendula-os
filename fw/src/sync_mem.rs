//! One-way memory loan for the Wi-Fi sync session.
//!
//! The radio blob wants roughly 100 KB of heap that this firmware does
//! not have while the reader pipeline owns its scratch. Sync is
//! therefore a terminal mode: the display task dismantles the EPUB
//! scratch into raw byte regions, the wifi task donates them (plus the
//! otherwise unused dram2 boot-loader shadow segment) to esp-alloc, and
//! the only way back to reading is the software reset that ends the
//! session. Nothing here may be touched by reader code after the loan;
//! the display task enforces that by refusing scratch-using storage
//! commands once it has handed the memory over.
