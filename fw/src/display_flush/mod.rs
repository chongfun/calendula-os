//! Panel flush backends behind the display task's seam.
//!
//! The display task drives four operations — `init_panel`, `flush`,
//! `prestage_previous`, `sleep_panel` — plus the shared `Epd` bus type.
//! Which controller implements them is a compile-time device choice; the
//! task never sees command bytes or RAM-plane names. Both controllers keep
//! a previous-frame plane for differential fast refreshes (SSD1677: RED
//! RAM; UC8253: DTM1), which is what `prestage_previous` and `flush`'s
//! `prev_staged` speak to.
