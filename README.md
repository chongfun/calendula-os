# MarigoldOS

MarigoldOS is a lightweight, open-source firmware for the XTEink X4 and X3 e-readers.

If you'd like to explore the OS without flashing a device,
[try the emulator](https://jon-vii.github.io/MarigoldOS/) in your browser — the
firmware's app and rendering code compiled to WebAssembly, with a simulated
e-ink display and a selection of public-domain books.

## Features

### Reading
- **EPUB 2 & 3** — native table of contents for each (EPUB 3 nav, NCX fallback)
- **Two typefaces** — Literata and Merriweather, with adjustable size, weight, and line spacing
- **Whole-book pagination cache** — a book parses once and reopens in tens of milliseconds
- **Fast page turns** — 473 ms end-to-end, within ~50 ms of the panel's rated floor

### Library & sync
- **Streamed catalog** — library size isn't bounded by RAM
- **Local Wi-Fi shelf** — upload, list, and delete books from your browser
- **Zero-config onboarding** — with no stored credentials, the reader raises an open hotspot with a captive portal and an on-screen QR code

### Try it
- **Browser emulator** — the real render code in WebAssembly, no device needed

## Development

```sh
cargo run -p fw --release                                       # build, flash, serial monitor
cargo test -p app-core -p proto --target aarch64-apple-darwin   # host tests
cargo run --manifest-path tools/emulator/Cargo.toml --target aarch64-apple-darwin \
  --no-default-features -- --scenario fixtures/scenarios --check fixtures/golden
```

Only flashing needs the device on USB; the app logic, parsers, renderer, and
emulator all build and test on a plain host. The nightly toolchain is pinned in
`rust-toolchain.toml`.

## Flashing

`cargo run` flashes over USB for development. To install without a toolchain —
from a built image, or onto a unit that shipped with USB flashing disabled —
`tools/build-release.sh` produces the images and [docs/FLASHING.md](docs/FLASHING.md)
covers the paths: web flasher, SD card, and the in-app update from the card.
