# MarigoldOS

MarigoldOS is a lightweight, open-source firmware for the Xteink X4 and X3 e-readers.

If you'd like to explore the OS without flashing a device,
[try the emulator](https://jon-vii.github.io/marigold-os/) in your browser — the
firmware's app and rendering code compiled to WebAssembly, with a simulated
e-ink display and a selection of public-domain books.

## Features

### Reading
- **EPUB 2 & 3** — native table of contents for each (EPUB 3 nav, NCX fallback)
- **Reader typefaces** — Literata and Merriweather, plus an optional custom typeface slot from the SD card
- **Whole-book pagination cache** — a book parses once and reopens in tens of milliseconds
- **Fast page turns** — 473 ms end-to-end, within ~50 ms of the panel's rated floor

### Library & sync
- **Streamed catalog** — library size isn't bounded by RAM
- **Local Wi-Fi shelf** — upload, list, and delete books from your browser
- **Zero-config onboarding** — with no stored credentials, the reader raises an open hotspot with a captive portal and an on-screen QR code

### Try it
- **Browser emulator** — the real render code in WebAssembly, no device needed

## Development

Prerequisites: install Rust with `rustup`, then install the firmware target and
release-image tool:

```sh
rustup target add riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf
cargo install espflash
```

```sh
tools/cargo.sh run -p fw --release                              # build, flash, serial monitor
tools/cargo.sh test -p app-core -p proto --target aarch64-apple-darwin
cargo run --manifest-path tools/emulator/Cargo.toml --target aarch64-apple-darwin \
  --no-default-features -- --scenario fixtures/scenarios --check fixtures/golden
tools/bench/bench.py channel-stress --host                       # host bench
```

Only flashing needs the device on USB; the app logic, parsers, renderer, and
emulator all build and test on a plain host. The stable toolchain is configured in
`rust-toolchain.toml`.

Hardware-facing bench runs live in `tools/bench`. Use short `page-turn` and
`sleep-sync` runs before trusting flashed builds after display, input, sleep,
reader rendering, SD/cache, or progress-write changes; use longer soak/storage
runs before risky merges or releases.

## Flashing

`cargo run` flashes over USB for development. To install without a toolchain —
from a built image, or onto a unit that shipped with USB flashing disabled —
tagged releases publish the app/SD images and [docs/FLASHING.md](docs/FLASHING.md)
covers the paths: web flasher, SD card, and the in-app update from the card.
