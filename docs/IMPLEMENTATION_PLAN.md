# Implementation plan

The repo has moved from hardware proof into a minimal reader shell. The current
target is still reliability before feature breadth.

## Phase 1: panel and buttons

Exit criteria:

- Build succeeds for `riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf`.
- Boot draws a simple reader shell framebuffer.
- Display task initializes SSD1677 and performs a full refresh.
- Power task requests SSD1677 deep sleep through the display task before MCU sleep.
- GPIO3 and ADC ladder buttons produce `InputEvent`s.
- App task updates a page counter from input.
- Power task can enter timer deep sleep after display settle.

Current code status:

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace and target setup | Done |
| Embassy executor | Done |
| Task boundaries | Done |
| Single 48 KB framebuffer | Done |
| SSD1677 init sequence | SDK-aligned, panel responds |
| Refresh path | Reader shell readable with `MIRROR_X=true`, `MIRROR_Y=false`, `REVERSE_BITS=true`; first update uses full refresh, normal page turns use deterministic fast differential refresh |
| Input backpressure | App accepts input while a render is in flight and coalesces display work to the latest state |
| Input polling | Measured calibrated ADC ladder bands plus CrossPoint-style layout mapping applied; screen shows reader-facing `PREV`/`NEXT`/`BACK`/`OK` labels |
| Reader app shell | Portrait Home/Library/Settings plus landscape Reading/Chapters present with catalog-backed book data |
| Battery display | GPIO0-derived rough battery mV/percent flows through input/app/render |
| Deep sleep | Idle/power sleep now renders a visible sleep screen before SSD1677 deep sleep; GPIO wake pending |
| Partial refresh | Deferred; full-screen fast refresh present |
| NVM progress | Deferred |
| Storage / EPUB / Wi-Fi | Explicit storage commands, FAT scan, `/books` then card-root discovery, catalog snapshot cache, and SD-backed hybrid-light section cache present; Wi-Fi still pending |
| Typography | Literata Latin-1 bitmap assets generated; Reading uses Literata for demo text |

## Phase 2: measured board support

- Current calibrated ADC bands on this unit: GPIO1 Back `2400..2700`, Confirm
  `1800..2150`, Previous-front `1000..1250`, Next-front `0..100`; GPIO2
  Previous-side `1500..1800`, Next-side `0..100`. Current layout mapping is
  direct front `BACK_CONFIRM_LEFT_RIGHT` and side `PREV_NEXT`. Raw
  GPIO0/GPIO1/GPIO2 serial logging is available behind `RAW_LOG_ENABLED`.
- GPIO0 battery sampling is present as a rough 2:1 divider estimate; calibrate
  against measured pack voltage.
- Add GPIO wake for the power/home button.
- Measured BUSY timings (June 10 2026, on-device, room temperature, commit
  `14c7eba` + page-plan seam, Unsong.epub 1001 pages / 78 chapters; from the
  permanent `bench:` serial lines via `tools/serial_capture.py`):
  - Fast-waveform refresh BUSY: **421 ms**, constant across 44 refreshes.
  - Full-waveform refresh BUSY: **3.53–3.61 s**. Dominates every view change,
    boot (~4.1 s to Home), and wake (~3.8 s to Home); software around it is
    noise, so any future improvement here is waveform/temperature
    configuration, not SPI or layout work.
  - Whole-frame RAM stream over band DMA: 22–24 ms per plane (BW or RED).
  - Layout + framebuffer draw: Reading 20–36 ms, menu views 82–90 ms.
  - EPUB page turn, button press to panel settled: **~470 ms median**
    (~89% is the fast BUSY wait); sustained held-button rate ≈ 2 pages/s.
    RED prestaging held on every fast turn (each streamed BW only), and
    SD-backed section extends (~50–85 ms v2 cache hits) never stalled a
    render. Add ~40–80 ms ADC poll + debounce ahead of the logged press for
    true finger-to-eye latency.
  - Book open with a v2 cache hit: cache ready in 50–85 ms; perceived ~4 s is
    the full refresh that paints the first page.
- Use the on-screen input calibration panel to record raw GPIO1/GPIO2 values for every button.

## Phase 3: reader core

- Add persistent page index.
- `AppStateRecord` exists as a versioned/checksummed storage record; flash-backed
  load/store implementation pending.
- Tiny in-flash/static book source is present as reader-shell pages.
- Home, library, active reading view, chapter navigation, and settings view are
  present as explicit app state. Home now uses the landscape Dock Clean layout
  with the four hardware-adjacent actions on the left and the current book on
  the right. Storage-backed EPUB entries fill the same model.
- `DisplayOrientation` exists with landscape buttons-bottom/top and portrait
  buttons-left/right modes; default is landscape buttons-bottom. It remains
  persisted for future reading-layout work but is not exposed in Settings.
- Keep app state as flat structs and render requests as small `Copy` messages.

## Phase 4: storage and EPUB

- `proto::storage` defines a bounded `BookStorage` trait, `/books`/card-root
  candidates, and case-insensitive `.epub` filtering.
- `proto::book` defines shared `BookMeta`, `BookProgress`, `ChapterMeta`, and
  catalog primitives used by Home, Files, Reading, and Chapters.
- `proto::epub` can locate ZIP central directories, read stored/deflated entries
  into caller-owned buffers, parse `META-INF/container.xml`, parse OPF metadata,
  manifest, and spine, and map XHTML tags into styled text runs.
- `proto::epub::ZipStream` can locate and read ZIP entries through a bounded
  `ReadAt` interface, so EPUBs no longer need to fit in memory. The firmware
  path now streams compressed deflate input in chunks, and XHTML spine entries
  can decode a bounded prefix for the first section cache instead of failing
  just because the section is larger than the XHTML scratch buffer.
- `proto::text` defines Literata/Merriweather-ready font/style roles and a
  deterministic one-screen paginator over bounded styled runs.
- `proto::cache` defines bounded binary cache records for book, TOC, section,
  page, line, word, and block data.
- Firmware Files/Home/Reading now consume the shared catalog/cache model through
  the refactored `ReaderStore`. Rendering and display-task coordination use
  ReaderStore query methods for catalog entries, active-book labels, selected
  cover data, advertised page counts, and source identity. The current in-flash
  demo book remains a fallback source while SD EPUB loading is hardened.
- The selected-book preview path has been replaced by `build_or_load_book_cache`.
  First open writes `/XTEINK/CACHE/E<hash>/BOOK.BIN`, builds the requested
  section into `/XTEINK/CACHE/E<hash>/SECTIONS/SNNN.BIN`, and renders from those
  flat records. Near-end NEXT requests a larger cached page target before
  rendering, so partial section caches can extend on demand.
- Home can now draw a selected-book cover bitmap from
  `/XTEINK/CACHE/E<hash>/COVER.BIN`. The firmware format is a fixed 202x303,
  1-bit, row-packed DOD bitmap; if it is absent or invalid, the Dock Clean
  fallback artwork is used. Host preview tooling can generate this cache file
  from an EPUB cover image.
- Current limitation: partial caches for very large single-XHTML spine items
  can render the first decoded chunk, but true byte-accurate resume inside that
  same compressed member is still pending.
- `BOOK.BIN` stores book/spine/TOC records plus a shared string blob. Section
  files store a section header, page records, block records, paragraph flags,
  and UTF-8 text bytes. Line/word cache records remain defined in `proto::cache`
  for the next rendering refinement; the current firmware renderer still draws
  styled block text with Literata.
- `/XTEINK/STATE.BIN` writes the encoded `AppStateRecord` for SD reading
  progress. Version 2 stores the volatile book id plus stable SD source identity
  derived from path and file size; boot/Home restore scans the card, maps the
  record back to the matching EPUB, and keeps v1 decode fallback for older state
  files.
- Home `Read` now resumes the restored/last-selected SD EPUB. If no current EPUB
  exists, it opens Files when SD books exist and falls back to the built-in book
  when the card is empty or unavailable.
- X4 SD pins are configured on the shared SPI bus: SCK GPIO8, MOSI GPIO10, MISO
  GPIO7, SD CS GPIO12. `embedded-sdmmc` is present with default features
  disabled.
- Render is side-effect free. `DisplayCommand::Render` only draws the current
  `ReaderStore` snapshot and flushes the panel. Rendering and task coordination
  read catalog, active-book, cover, TOC, page-count, and source-identity data
  through ReaderStore query methods rather than reassembling its parallel arrays
  directly. SD discovery, EPUB cache construction, and progress writes run only
  through explicit `StorageCommand`s after the visible render settles.
- Firmware SD/FAT work now goes through `fw::sd_session`, which owns the shared
  SPI card-mount/root-open/restore-speed ceremony. EPUB cache file persistence
  lives in `fw::reader_cache_files`, leaving `fw::reader_cache` focused on the
  EPUB-to-section-cache pipeline.
- The board I/O/display task remains the single runtime coordinator for
  serialized EPD and SD transactions, while SD sessions, SD discovery, cache
  file I/O, EPUB cache construction, reader layout, view drawing, and EPD
  flushing now live in deeper `fw` modules.
- Files is instant and catalog-backed. `/XTEINK/CATALOG.BIN` stores a flat fixed
  record list of discovered EPUBs. Firmware may show “Library unavailable” while
  no catalog snapshot exists; it shows “No books available” only after a
  completed scan proves there are no EPUBs.

## Phase 4b: typography and preview

- `tools/generate_literata.py` downloads OFL Literata TTFs and generates Latin-1
  bitmap tables for Regular, Italic, Bold, and BoldItalic.
- `display::font` renders generated bitmap glyphs directly into the framebuffer.
- Reading mode and the chapter navigation screen use Literata; tiny 5x7 remains
  for debug/status chrome and non-reader utility views.
- `tools/preview` exports PBM/PNG snapshots for Home, Files, Reading, Chapters,
  and Settings into `target/previews`. It can also render EPUB parser previews
  from host-side files for layout inspection before flashing.

## Phase 4c: development emulator

- `app-core` now owns the shared reader message types and pure `ReaderState`
  reducer. Firmware keeps the Embassy channels and task shell, while host tools
  can drive the same navigation/library/restore logic without ESP HAL.
- `display::epd::fill_transformed_band` exposes the validated X4 panel byte/bit
  transform so firmware and emulator stream the same panel RAM layout.
- `tools/emulator` provides a deterministic headless runner plus an optional
  egui frontend behind `--features gui`. Headless mode accepts one TOML scenario
  or a scenario directory, applies scripted button/library events, validates app
  and panel state, writes PNG frame dumps, and compares against golden PNGs.
- The emulator includes an SSD1677-oriented panel model that tracks BW/RED RAM,
  address ranges/counters, refresh controls, refresh mode history, and deep
  sleep validation. It is a protocol model, not an analog e-paper or ESP32-C3
  timing emulator.
- Scenarios live under `fixtures/scenarios`; matching golden frames live under
  `fixtures/golden`. Add or update both before/alongside UI/navigation changes
  so agents can verify behavior before flashing hardware.

## Phase 5: Wi-Fi sync

- esp-wifi 0.12.0 linked from crates.io on the esp-hal 0.23.1 stack
  (esp-hal-embassy 0.6, embassy-executor 0.7, embassy-time 0.4, embassy-net
  0.6); trimmed `ESP_WIFI_CONFIG_*` buffer counts live in `.cargo/config.toml`.
- RAM accounting after linking the radio: PREV_FB moved into dram2, a 16 KB
  dram2 heap claim, and the loaned EPUB scratch give the session ~84 KB of
  esp-alloc heap in three regions while the stack region holds at ~41 KB
  (down from 43 KB; re-measure the EPUB open chain with -Zemit-stack-sizes
  before deepening that path).
- kosync progress sync implemented end to end pending hardware validation:
  Sync screen (Home -> sync key) -> SyncCommand::Start -> memory loan ->
  STA join -> DHCP -> GET/PUT /syncs/progress with KOReader partial-MD5
  document ids -> SyncEvents back to the screen -> Exit resets the device.
  Scenario coverage in `fixtures/scenarios/sync-*.toml`; protocol host tests
  in `proto::kosync`.
- Dev credentials are compile-time: build with `XTEINK_WIFI_SSID`,
  `XTEINK_WIFI_PASS`, `XTEINK_KOSYNC_HOST` (host or host:port, plain HTTP),
  `XTEINK_KOSYNC_USER`, `XTEINK_KOSYNC_PASS`.
- On-device validation (June 11 2026, esp-hal 0.23 stack): the full session
  ran on hardware — Confirm started it, the loan + book gather + radio init
  completed, the station joined and got 192.168.0.233 via DHCP (~21 s from
  Start to address; the 20 s join timeout deserves headroom or scan tuning),
  status repaints rode the 438 ms fast refresh, USB serial survived radio
  init, Back reset the device, and the saved position (page 619/ch 87) came
  back intact after reboot. A later same-day run validated the kosync
  exchange in both directions against a LAN server: push (GET 404 -> PUT,
  document id `bfc024...` partial-MD5, percentage 0.549), then pull (server
  planted at 0.9 -> `kosync: pulled permille=900` -> StoreProgress -> boot
  restore at screen 1016/chapter 127). Still pending: a heap high-water
  reading (log esp_alloc::HEAP stats during a session) and interop against
  a real kosync server implementation rather than a protocol stub.
- AP-mode web onboarding validated on hardware June 11 2026: the hotspot
  raised, the phone leased an address, and submitted credentials landed in
  WIFI.BIN (the user typed the portal URL manually that run; the DNS
  responder's silence on AAAA/HTTPS queries was stalling captive
  detection and is fixed since, untested on a phone). Still to observe on
  serial: a station join sourced from WIFI.BIN rather than compile-time
  credentials, and the auto-raised sign-in sheet. Details: with no
  WIFI.BIN and no compile-time credentials, Confirm on the Sync screen
  raises an open XTEINK-X4 hotspot at 192.168.4.1 with hand-rolled captive
  DHCP/DNS (proto::captive, host-tested) and a credential form; submitted
  credentials persist through StoreWifiCredentials into /XTEINK/WIFI.BIN
  and the next session joins as a station. Join QR baked by
  tools/generate_qr.py. Stack region after the portal: ~38.9 KB.
- Browser EPUB upload validated end to end on hardware June 11 2026: a
  2.4 MB EPUB traveled browser -> Wi-Fi -> loaned buffers -> /BOOKS and
  surfaced on the shelf after the rescan; the page lists the catalog with
  per-book removal (both /BOOKS and card-root entries) and shows real
  upload progress. Found live and fixed: a literal newline inside the
  page's JS string (parse error masked every other symptom), the kosync
  exchange clobbering the catalog in the loaned http_b, missing UTF-8
  charset, and the catalog snapshot hiding new books from the boot scan.
  Implementation: after the
  kosync exchange the session keeps serving at the device's LAN address
  (SyncStatus::Serving screen hands out the URL); POST /upload streams raw
  EPUB bytes through a two-buffer ping-pong into the display task, which
  holds one SD session for the upload phase and writes /BOOKS/<8.3>.EPU
  (the catalog filter accepts .epu alongside .epub). Books appear after the
  session-ending reset's rescan. Stack region ~36.7 KB after the upload
  futures; the EPUB-open chain's ~30 KB watermark is the floor to respect.
- Next: kosync account onboarding via the portal form, and TLS for the
  official sync server.
