# Prepare a CalendulaOS release: sync every hand-maintained version/size label
# to the given semver, and verify the firmware carries the matching stamps.
#
# Usage: tools/prepare-release.sh <version>     e.g. tools/prepare-release.sh 0.5.0
#
# What it updates:
#   fw/Cargo.toml    package version — the app descriptor's `version` stamp is
#                    env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"), so the tag lies unless this matches.
#   Cargo.lock       refreshed by the build below.
#   web/index.html   the flasher's Version cell, Size cell (measured from the
#                    freshly built image), and the "vX.Y.Z release notes" line.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT do: commit, push, tag, or touch GitHub.
# The release itself is created by CI when a v* tag is pushed — never
# pre-create it by hand (see docs/agents/release.md).

Next steps (human decides when):

  git push origin main
  git tag v$VER && git push origin v$VER      # tag push triggers the release CI

Do NOT create the GitHub release by hand (UI or gh release create): the
release workflow creates it and uploads the assets; a pre-created release
makes that step fail and leaves the release empty, which also blocks the
Pages deploy. Verification steps: docs/agents/release.md.
