# Build the distributable firmware images for the Xteink X4 or X3.
#
# Usage: tools/build-release.sh [x4|x3]   (default x4)
#
# Produces local development images in target/release-images/ (X3 images carry an
# -x3 suffix):
#   firmware.bin    app image for OTA slot app0/ota_0. Flash to 0x10000. This is
#                   what the web flasher, `esptool write_flash 0x10000`, and the
#                   in-app SD/OTA updater consume. Leaves the bootloader intact.
#   FWUPDATE.BIN    byte-identical to firmware.bin, under the filename the
#   (FWUPDX3.BIN)   in-app SD updater looks for on the card root. The name is
#                   device-specific so a card can't cross-flash the wrong panel.
#   full-flash.bin  merged 16 MB image (bootloader + partition table + app) for
#                   programming a whole *unlocked* unit from scratch with
#                   `esptool write_flash 0x0`. NEVER put this on an SD card and
#                   NEVER write it to 0x10000 — it would land a bootloader in the
#                   app slot and brick the device.
#
# GitHub releases publish only app/SD images: firmware-x4.bin, firmware-x3.bin,
# update.bin, and FWUPDX3.BIN. full-flash*.bin remains local-only.
#
# The app images carry our app descriptor (magic 0xABCD5432 at image offset
# 0x20) with the wide-open eFuse-revision range, which is what lets the stock
# bootloader on a locked unit accept a non-stock image.
