# Implementation plan

The repo has moved from hardware proof into a minimal reader shell. The current
target is still reliability before feature breadth.

## Phase 1: panel and buttons

Exit criteria:

- Build succeeds for `riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf`.
- Boot draws a simple reader shell framebuffer.
- Display task initializes SSD1677 and performs a full refresh.
- Power task requests SSD1677 deep sleep through the display task before MCU sleep.
- GPIO3 and ADC ladder buttons produce `InputEvent`s.
- App task updates a page counter from input.
- Power task can enter timer deep sleep after display settle.

Current code status:

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace and target setup | Done |
| Embassy executor | Done |
| Task boundaries | Done |
| Single 48 KB framebuffer | Done |
| SSD1677 init sequence | SDK-aligned, panel responds |
| Refresh path | Reader shell readable with `MIRROR_X=true`, `MIRROR_Y=false`, `REVERSE_BITS=true`; first update uses full refresh, normal page turns use deterministic fast differential refresh |
| Input backpressure | App accepts input while a render is in flight and coalesces display work to the latest state |
| Input polling | Measured calibrated ADC ladder bands plus CrossPoint-style layout mapping applied; screen shows reader-facing `PREV`/`NEXT`/`BACK`/`OK` labels |
| Reader app shell | Portrait Home/Library/Settings plus landscape Reading/Chapters present with catalog-backed book data |
| Battery display | GPIO0-derived rough battery mV/percent flows through input/app/render |
| Deep sleep | Timer wake + display-sleep handshake present, GPIO wake pending |
| Partial refresh | Deferred; full-screen fast refresh present |
| NVM progress | Deferred |
| Storage / EPUB / Wi-Fi | EPUB stream reader, FAT scan, `/books` then card-root discovery, and selected-book preview loading present; Wi-Fi still pending |
| Typography | Literata Latin-1 bitmap assets generated; Reading uses Literata for demo text |

## Phase 2: measured board support

- Current calibrated ADC bands on this unit: GPIO1 Back `2400..2700`, Confirm
  `1800..2150`, Previous-front `1000..1250`, Next-front `0..100`; GPIO2
  Previous-side `1500..1800`, Next-side `0..100`. Current layout mapping is
  direct front `BACK_CONFIRM_LEFT_RIGHT` and side `PREV_NEXT`. Raw
  GPIO0/GPIO1/GPIO2 serial logging is available behind `RAW_LOG_ENABLED`.
- GPIO0 battery sampling is present as a rough 2:1 divider estimate; calibrate
  against measured pack voltage.
- Add GPIO wake for the power/home button.
- Record measured BUSY timings in this document.
- Use the on-screen input calibration panel to record raw GPIO1/GPIO2 values for every button.

## Phase 3: reader core

- Add persistent page index.
- `AppStateRecord` exists as a versioned/checksummed storage record; flash-backed
  load/store implementation pending.
- Tiny in-flash/static book source is present as reader-shell pages.
- Home, library, active reading view, chapter navigation, and settings view are
  present as explicit app state. Home/Library/Settings render in portrait; Reading
  and Chapters render in landscape. Home is cover-led with
  Continue/Library/Settings. Storage-backed EPUB entries should fill the same
  model.
- `DisplayOrientation` exists with landscape buttons-bottom/top and portrait
  buttons-left/right modes; default is landscape buttons-bottom.
- Keep app state as flat structs and render requests as small `Copy` messages.

## Phase 4: storage and EPUB

- `proto::storage` defines a bounded `BookStorage` trait, `/books`/card-root
  candidates, and case-insensitive `.epub` filtering.
- `proto::book` defines shared `BookMeta`, `BookProgress`, `ChapterMeta`, and
  catalog primitives used by Home, Files, Reading, and Chapters.
- `proto::epub` can locate ZIP central directories, read stored/deflated entries
  into caller-owned buffers, parse `META-INF/container.xml`, parse OPF metadata,
  manifest, and spine, and map XHTML tags into styled text runs.
- `proto::epub::ZipStream` can locate and read ZIP entries through a bounded
  `ReadAt` interface, so EPUBs no longer need to fit in memory.
- `proto::text` defines Literata/Bookerly-ready font/style roles and a
  deterministic one-screen paginator over bounded styled runs.
- `proto::cache` defines bounded binary cache records for book, TOC, section,
  page, line, word, and block data.
- Firmware Files/Home/Reading now consume the shared catalog/cache model through
  the refactored `ReaderStore`. The current in-flash demo book remains a
  fallback source while SD EPUB loading is hardened.
- X4 SD pins are configured on the shared SPI bus: SCK GPIO8, MOSI GPIO10, MISO
  GPIO7, SD CS GPIO12. `embedded-sdmmc` is present with default features
  disabled.
- The display task remains the single runtime coordinator for serialized EPD and
  SD transactions, while SD discovery, EPUB cache construction, reader layout,
  view drawing, and EPD flushing now live in deeper `fw` modules.

## Phase 4b: typography and preview

- `tools/generate_literata.py` downloads OFL Literata TTFs and generates Latin-1
  bitmap tables for Regular, Italic, Bold, and BoldItalic.
- `display::font` renders generated bitmap glyphs directly into the framebuffer.
- Reading mode uses Literata for the current demo text; tiny 5x7 remains for
  debug/status chrome.
- `tools/preview` exports PBM snapshots for Home, Files, Reading, Chapters, and
  Settings into `target/previews`.

## Phase 5: Wi-Fi sync

- Enable `esp-wifi`.
- Keep transfer chunks caller-owned or borrowed, not embedded as large enum
  variants.
- Write book data directly to storage in bounded chunks.
